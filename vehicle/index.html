    <p>The main purpose of this paper is to integrate GPS recievers, electronical
compass, stereo camera, ultrasonic sensors, and dynamic system, developing a
PC-based unmanned vehicle system for outdoor navigation. The main system
comprises three parts: main station, reference station, and the vehicle. GPS signals
received by reference station and vehicle are utilized to determine the position of the
vehicle by Carrier Smoothed Code method. Electronical compass senses the heading
angle of vehicle. Stereo camera and ultrasonic sensors are employed to detect
obstalces, and obstalce-avoiding action is taken if obstacles exist. Main station
monitors the motion of the vehicle, and the information is exchanged via wireless
network.</p>

<p>SRI Stereo Engine(API) and the concept of "grids" are utilized to determine the
relative distance between the vehicle and obstalces. Once the positions of obstacles
are known, a path along which the vehicle can avoid those obstacles is decided by
Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree method. Six ultrasonic sensors are assembled and
controlled through FPGA board, and a rule-based system is utilized to deal with the
data collected by ultasonic sensor system, determining the corresponding linear
velocity and angular velocity output in order to avoid nearby obstacles.
An operation flow is developed to integrate these obstacle avoidance modes,
making the vehicle choose the proper mode. Besides, the vehicle is able to switch
from one mode to another correctly. Experimental results described in this thesis
proves that the proposed navigation and control methodolgy are feasible.
